I am currently a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the National Institute of Applied Sciences of Strasbourg (INSA Strasbourg). I am deeply interested in physical sciences and applied mathematics, and I enjoy exploring how theoretical concepts can be transformed into practical solutions.

My main areas of interest include control systems, computer vision, and machine learning. I am particularly drawn to projects that bridge multiple fields of physics, as interdisciplinary approaches are what excite me the most.

Beyond engineering, I enjoy playing sports (especially basketball), as well as board games and reading. Looking ahead, I hope to pursue a career in Research and Development, whether in academia or industry, working on projects that I find both meaningful and intellectually stimulating.
